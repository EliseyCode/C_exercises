/* Now modify the program of Programming Exercise 5 so that it computes the sum of the
squares of the integers. (If you prefer, how much money you receive if you get $1 the
first day, $4 the second day, $9 the third day, and so on. This looks like a much better
deal!) C doesnâ€™t have a squaring function, but you can use the fact that the square of  n  is
 n * n. */
